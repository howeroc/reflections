When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work with my partners, and want to share my codes with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe there something changes on the remote I don't want to get to my local version.
